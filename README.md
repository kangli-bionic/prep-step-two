# Technical Interview Practice Problems

Hey folks,

Welcome to App Academy's Technical Interview Prep. This prepwork consists of nine practice problems (three easy, three medium, and three hard) that will prepare you for your technical interview. Each level of difficulty features a primer video, in which we'll walk through a problem. We highly recommend that you watch them to warm up and to get a better sense of how to approach more sophisticated problems.

Before you begin this step, you should have completed our Step 1 curriculum and passed the online coding assessment. Feel free to refer to the Step 1 curriculum to refresh your fundamentals.

When you've finished the practice problems and reviewed the prep material found [here][tech-interview], you should be well prepared for your technical interview over Skype with a TA from App Academy.

If you have extra time before the interview and would like more practice, we recommend you check out some of the additional resources in the "How To Prepare" section [here][tech-interview].
